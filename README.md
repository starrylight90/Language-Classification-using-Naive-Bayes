# Language-Classification-using-Naive-Bayes
This repository contains a project on Language Classification. It contains code from a research paper too which I have mentioned within the jupyter notebook. The three languages I have used are Czech, Slovak and English. <br>
I have saved the model in <a href="https://github.com/starrylight90/Language-Classification-using-Naive-Bayes/blob/main/Data/Models/final_model.joblib"> final_model.joblib </a> <br>
The usage of Naive-Bayes Method of Probability was useful as it helped fill the gaps due to the dataset availability. <br>
The entire project was divided in 5 tasks: <b>
1. Exploratory Data Analysis and Visualization. <br>
2. Data Cleaning and Preprocessing. <br>
3. Naive Bayes Model Training. <br>
4. Highlighting Problems with the basic Model and suggesting Simple Fixes. <br>
5. Advanced Approach to Further Improve Performance.</b>
